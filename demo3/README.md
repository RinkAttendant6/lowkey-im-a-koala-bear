# Demo 3 - Object-oriented ES6, OOP principles

The examples here demonstrate progressively improving code that follows object-oriented programming principles, primarily focusing on encapsulation.

## Requirements

- Node.js 4+
- A browser that supports the following ES6 features:
  - [Arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)
  - [Class declaration](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)
  - [let statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let)

## Run

```shell
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

A web server will start running. By default, it will listen on port 3000. If you wish to listen on another port, run `npm start -- --port=PORT_NUMBER`.

Go to your browser and navigate to `http://[::1]:3000/` (or whatever port number you used).

By default example 4 is live. All the examples do the same thing. Read the code in each file in the `js/` directory for more information.

To quit the server, press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>.
